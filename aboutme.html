		  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
		  <p>Some of my favorite thigs to do include yoga, hikinh, taking pictures, and cooking. I try to stay as active as I can which is why I love yoga and hiking, not only are they a form of excercise but it is a way for me to unwind and enjoy myself. I have always had a passion for taking pictures and have recently started takign pictures as a hobby. My passion for cooking is not only because I love to eat but I love being in the kitchen and creating new things, it is sort of a science lab for me where I can experiement with many ingredients and create new foods. </p>

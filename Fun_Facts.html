    <h2>What I Enjoy:</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Yoga</h3>
      <p>One of my favorite past time activities is yoga. I think I found a passion for yoga because it is a great way to relax and unwind while still getting a workout. When I get on my mat I am able to block any worries or stress that I have from coming into my mind during my practice. I stress very easily and I get a lot of anxiety when I have too much going on in my life and yoga has taught me how to balance things out so I can be happier and more relaxed. </p>

    <h4>Cooking</h4>
    	<p>Ever since I was little I had a passion for being in the kitchen cooking and baking. Cooking runs in my family, all of my aunts and grandmothers are amazing chefs and we have thousands of family recipies. When I was younger, my mother was always cooking in the kitchen and I would try and help her but I usually made a mess so she wouldn't let me help. Whenever I tried baking stuff she knew I would make a mess so she preffered I not go into the kitchen because she would end up being the one that would clean my mess. My mother not letting me be in the kitchen would make me want to be in there even more, which is where I think I started developing my passion for cooking. One of my favorite things about cooking is that you get to try everything you make and who doesn't love eating, so for me it's a win-win situation.  </p>

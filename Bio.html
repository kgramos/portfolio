		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>	I was born and raised in El Paso, TX. I am a rising high school senior at El Paso High School. I am very excited to finish high school and cannot wait to go into college. If I had to describe myself in three words they would be: active, adventureous, and hard working. I love being active, whether it be playing sports, having things to do, or just excercising. I am the kind of person that cannot stay in one place for too long, which is why I have to constantly be doing something. If anyone were to come up to me and ask if I wanted to go on an adventure, never in a million years would I say no. I love discovering new things and traveling. I find that there is such an excitment in going to new places, trying new things, and meeting new people. Along with being adventerous and having fun come responsibilites such as school and work. I am very studious and I try to be as active as I can in both my school and community. I am currently the Student Council president at my school, captain of my tennis team, and have been very involved in school all throughout high school. </p>
